/**In this project, you’re going to make your own table with some small set of “famous people”, 
then make more tables about things they do and join those to create nice human readable lists.

For example, here are types of famous people and the questions your data could answer:

Movie stars: What movies are they in? Are they married to each other?
Singers: What songs did they write? Where are they from?
Authors: What books did they write?
Fictional characters: How are they related to other characters? What books do they show up in?**/


/* Create table about the people and what they do here */

CREATE TABLE famous_persons (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER, nationality TEXT);

INSERT INTO famous_persons VALUES (1, "Vin Diesel", 55, "U.S");
INSERT INTO famous_persons VALUES (2, "Morgan Freeman ",85 , "U.S");
INSERT INTO famous_persons VALUES (3, "Ariana Grande", 29 , "U.S");
INSERT INTO famous_persons VALUES (4, "Priyanka Chopra",40 , "India");
INSERT INTO famous_persons VALUES (5, "Rihanna", 35, "Barbados");
INSERT INTO famous_persons VALUES (6, "The Weeknd", 33, "Canada"); 
INSERT INTO famous_persons VALUES (7, "Beyonce", 41, "U.S"); 
INSERT INTO famous_persons VALUES (8, "J.K. Rowling", 57, "British");

CREATE TABLE profession (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, person_id TEXT, name TEXT);

INSERT INTO profession VALUES (1, 1, "actor");
INSERT INTO profession VALUES (2, 2, "actor");
INSERT INTO profession VALUES (3, 3, "singer");
INSERT INTO profession VALUES (4, 4, "actress");
INSERT INTO profession VALUES (5, 5, "singer");
INSERT INTO profession VALUES (6, 6, "singer");
INSERT INTO profession VALUES (7, 7, "singer");
INSERT INTO profession VALUES (8, 8, "author");

SELECT famous_persons.name, profession.name FROM famous_persons
JOIN profession ON famous_persons.id = profession.person_id;
